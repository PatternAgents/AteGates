AteGates (pronounced as "Eight Gates") is a simple eight (8) bit I/O module,
where any Gate (Jack) can either be an input or an output.
Eight (8) LED's indicate the state of the Gate, and Eight (8) Pushbuttons allow
for manual playing and testing of each Gate.

AteGates can be used on a breadboard for prototyping new circuits,
or it can mounted into a 1U Rack system using the following 1U x 16 HP front panel design.

AteGates can be used in combination with two (2) or more other ERA modules
for mounting in a 3U ERA or Eurorack format card or even larger rack format
.
Any Jack/Gate can be configured to be either an input or an output (at build time),
by placing two (2) resistors in different places (as jumpers).

# Using AteGates

1) Breadboard : AteGates uses male pins on the bottom side of the PCB for breadboard applications.
2) thingSoC1UG : AteGates can plug into any thingSoC1UG (1U Gate) board for adding microprocessor interfaces like MIDI or OSC.


**thingSoC Reference Designs** are example thingSoC implementations that implement
various reference and testing circuits for demonstrating the use of the thingSoC libraries.
These reference designs can serve as starting templates for user designs.
