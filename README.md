# AteGates : Eight (8) Gate I/O Board (Breadboard Friendly) 

Format : ERA / Eurorack

Height : 1U 

Width: 16HP

Depth : 1.0 cm

Power : 3.3V/5.0V capable (5.0V Eurorack default)

AteGates (pronounced as "Eight Gates") is a simple eight (8) bit I/O module,
where any Gate (Jack) can either be an input or an output.
Eight (8) LED's indicate the state of the Gate, and Eight (8) Pushbuttons allow
for manual playing and testing of each Gate.

AteGates can be used on a breadboard for prototyping new circuits,
or it can mounted into a 1U using the following front panel design.

AteGates can be used in combination with two (2) or more other ERA modules
for mounting in a 3U ERA or Eurorack format card or even larger rack format
.
Any Jack/Gate can be configured to be either an input or an output (at build time),
by placing two (2) resistors in different places (as jumpers).

For using on a Breadboard, AteGates follows the thingSoC standard connector layout as shown below :

**thingSoC Reference Designs** are example thingSoC implementations that implement
various reference and testing circuits for demonstrating the use of the thingSoC libraries.
These reference designs can serve as starting templates for user designs.
